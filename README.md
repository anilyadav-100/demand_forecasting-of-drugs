# Demand Forecasting Project
## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust demand forecasting model using historical data. The goal is to predict future demand accurately, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic planning.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: The project includes a comprehensive analysis of historical demand data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Model Development**: Several machine learning models are implemented to forecast future demand, including ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.
- **Model Evaluation**: Each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE) to determine the most accurate model.
- **Visualization**: The project includes visualizations to help understand the data and model performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Statsmodels** (for ARIMA and SARIMA)
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** (for LSTM)
- **Prophet** (for Prophet model)

You can install these packages using pip:
